# 12. Contributing

We welcome contributions in the following areas:
- New/optimized transformers: cover more DSL scenarios;
- Better TypedQuery rules: support more call shapes;
- Debug UX improvements: richer dumps and friendlier logs;
- Tests: IR-level behavior should have clear unit test coverage.

Guidelines:
- Please file an issue first describing your need or problem;
- Run `kronos-compiler-plugin` tests before submitting;
- Follow project style and static checks (detekt, etc.).
