## Update Logs

### 0.0.1

> **Note**
>If you are using **kotlin `2.0.0`, you can use **Kronos** `0.0.1-kt-2.0.0` version**
>
> <span style="visibility:hidden">;</span>
> 
>(We provide it because many projects are still using `2.0.0` version of Kotlin and are unable to upgrade to `2.1.0` version due to dependency library versioning issues.)
>
> <span style="visibility:hidden">;</span>
> 
>**Although we have provided a compatible version for kt2.0.0, we still recommend that you upgrade to the `2.1.0` version as soon as possible, because the new features of Kronos will only be updated in the `2.1.0` version and higher.**

> **Note**
> The current version is in the development stage and does not guarantee backward compatibility.
>
> If you are interested, you can use the latest version for testing.
