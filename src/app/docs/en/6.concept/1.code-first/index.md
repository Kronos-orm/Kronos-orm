ORM (Object-Relational Mapping, Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique for mapping between an object model and a
relational database.ORM allows developers to manipulate databases using object-oriented programming without having to
write direct SQL statements.
In ORM, "Code First" is a development methodology that emphasizes defining database structures from code. Specifically,
the developer first defines the data model by writing classes (usually entity classes), and then the ORM framework
automatically generates database tables and relationships based on these classes. Here are some key features of Code
First:

1. **Model First**: The developer defines the entity classes and their properties first, rather than designing the
   database table structure first. This approach allows developers to focus more on business logic.
2. **Automatic Migration**: Many ORM frameworks (such as Entity Framework) support an automatic migration feature that
   automatically updates the database structure based on changes in the code. This reduces the effort of manually
   modifying database tables.
3. **Flexibility**: The Code First approach makes it easier to make model changes and adjustments during development
   because the database structure is code driven.
4. **Configuration Method**: Developers can configure the mapping relationships of entity classes, such as specifying
   primary keys, foreign keys, column names, etc., through Data Annotations or the Fluent API.
5. **Version Control**: Since the database structure is generated by code, developers can incorporate changes to the
   data model into a version control system (e.g., Git), which makes team collaboration and code review easier.

### Example

Suppose we have a simple user entity class:
```kotlin
data class User(
   val id: Int?
   val name: String?
   val email: String?
): KPojo
```
Using Code First, the ORM framework automatically generates a database table named `user` with the fields `id`, `name`
and `email` based on this class.

### Summary

Code First is a convenient and efficient way to approach database development, especially for rapid development and
iterative scenarios. It allows developers to manage and maintain the data model directly at the code level, thus
increasing development efficiency and flexibility.
